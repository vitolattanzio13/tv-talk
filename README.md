# TvTalk

Rails app built from scratch. At LeWagon coding bootcamp we discovered that if you wanted to have discussions about movies, there were no places to do so. We set out to build, in a team of three, a website that could solve this problem.
In TvTalk you can start a discussion based on a movie, join other discussions, or reply to individual posts. Also you can keep in touch with your friends and share private opinions and suggestions between yourselves, or share them with others.
